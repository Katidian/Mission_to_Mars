# Mission to Mars web-scraping project

We created a Mars-focused website and used web-scraping to pull in: 
- The latest news article from https://redplanetscience.com 
- A featured image from https://spaceimages-mars.com
- Some basic Mars facts from https://galaxyfacts-mars.com
- High-resolution images of Mars' hemispheres from https://marshemispheres.com

We automated a web browswer to retrieve the data from these websites, stored the data in a NoSQL database (MongoDB), and used Flask to render the data in a web 
application.
